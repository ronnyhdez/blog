# A place to find notes about my journey creating data science products

Hi! I'm Ronny A. Hern√°ndez Mora. I have been working in the data science industry
for several years and I have learned from many people who create free resources
over the internet and that also are my friends and co-workers. So I decided to
be more serious about sharing tricks and tips about R, linux, git and other tools
that I use to develop data products.

Feel free to use and share whatever you find useful in the blog posts!
