I have been working in the data science industry for several years and I have learned from many people who create free resources over the internet and that also are my friends and co-workers. So I decided to be more serious about sharing tricks and tips about R, linux, git and other tools that I use to develop data products.\nFeel free to use and share whatever you find useful in the blog posts!\n\n\n\n",
