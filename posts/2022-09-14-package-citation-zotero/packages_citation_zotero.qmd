# Why?

When working on your research project, probably you will need to cite the
R packages used in your data analysis. Also, probably you use Zotero as your
reference manager, so, how can you manage the R packages references in Zotero?

Well, here I will show you one **manual** way to do it.


# Obtain the package citation

This one is easy. You just use the function `citation("dplyr") and in your
console will appear all the bibliographic info from that package.

```{r}
citation("dplyr")
```

Now, you need to pay attention on the section that says: `A BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is`

# Creating the BibTex file

From where the `@` starts, that's what you need. So, copy  (be aware
of selecting the last `}` line) and paste it in a text file. This can be your
`Text Editor` in ubuntu, Notepad, notes or even a Text File in your RStudio.

You can copy and paste as many references you need. It can look something like
this:

```
@Article{,
  title = {{weathercan}: {D}ownload and format weather data from Environment and Climate Change Canada},
  author = {Stefanie E LaZerte and Sam Albers},
  journal = {The Journal of Open Source Software},
  volume = {3},
  number = {22},
  pages = {571},
  year = {2018},
  url = {https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00571},
}

@Manual{,
 title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing},
 author = {{R Core Team}},
 organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},
 address = {Vienna, Austria},
 year = {2021},
 url = {https://www.R-project.org/},
}

@Manual{,
  title = {dplyr: A Grammar of Data Manipulation},
  author = {Hadley Wickham and Romain François and Lionel Henry and Kirill Müller},
  year = {2022},
  note = {R package version 1.0.9},
  url = {https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr},
}
```

Save it with the extention `.bib`:

# Importing the file in Zotero

Open Zotero and look for the option `import`. It will open a window.

Select the option `(BibTex, RIS, Zotero RDF, etc.)` and from there, look the
file in the path you saved. Open the file and a new window will pop up. The
options to select there are up to you:

Finally, you will see that you have the references imported to Zotero!
