Also, probably you use Zotero as your\nreference manager, so, how can you manage the R packages references in Zotero?\n\nWell, here I will show you one **manual** way to do it.\n\n\n# Obtain the package citation\n\nThis one is easy. You just use the function `citation(\"dplyr\") and in your\nconsole will appear all the bibliographic info from that package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncitation(\"dplyr\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nTo cite package 'dplyr' in publications use:\n\n  Wickham H, François R, Henry L, Müller K (2022). _dplyr: A Grammar of\n  Data Manipulation_. R package version 1.0.9,\n  <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr>.\n\nA BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is\n\n  @Manual{,\n    title = {dplyr: A Grammar of Data Manipulation},\n    author = {Hadley Wickham and Romain François and Lionel Henry and Kirill Müller},\n    year = {2022},\n    note = {R package version 1.0.9},\n    url = {https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr},\n  }\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow, you need to pay attention on the section that says: `A BibTeX entry for LaTeX users is`\n\n# Creating the BibTex file\n\nFrom where the `@` starts, that's what you need. So, copy  (be aware\nof selecting the last `}` line) and paste it in a text file. This can be your\n`Text Editor` in ubuntu, Notepad, notes or even a Text File in your RStudio.\n\nYou can copy and paste as many references you need. It can look something like\nthis:\n\n```\n@Article{,\n  title = {{weathercan}: {D}ownload and format weather data from Environment and Climate Change Canada},\n  author = {Stefanie E LaZerte and Sam Albers},\n  journal = {The Journal of Open Source Software},\n  volume = {3},\n  number = {22},\n  pages = {571},\n  year = {2018},\n  url = {https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.00571},\n}\n\n@Manual{,\n title = {R: A Language and Environment for Statistical Computing},\n author = {{R Core Team}},\n organization = {R Foundation for Statistical Computing},\n address = {Vienna, Austria},\n year = {2021},\n url = {https://www.R-project.org/},\n}\n\n@Manual{,\n  title = {dplyr: A Grammar of Data Manipulation},\n  author = {Hadley Wickham and Romain François and Lionel Henry and Kirill Müller},\n  year = {2022},\n  note = {R package version 1.0.9},\n  url = {https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=dplyr},\n}\n```\n\nSave it with the extention `.bib`:\n\n![](images/save_bib.png)\n\n# Importing the file in Zotero\n\nOpen Zotero and look for the option `import`. It will open a window.\n\n![](images/import_zotero.png)\n\n\nSelect the option `(BibTex, RIS, Zotero RDF, etc.)` and from there, look the\nfile in the path you saved. Open the file and a new window will pop up. The\noptions to select there are up to you:\n\n![](images/import_zotero_2.png)\n\nFinally, you will see that you have the references imported to Zotero!\n\n\n\n\n\n",
